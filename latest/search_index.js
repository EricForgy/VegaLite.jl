    "text": "VegaLite.jl enables the generation of Vega-Lite plots from Julia.Vega-Lite (http://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) is a visualization grammar describing mappings from data to graphical properties (marks, axes, scales, ..). For rendering it uses pre-defined design rules that keep the visualization specification succinct while still leaving user control.Vega-Lite supports :data transformation, sorting, filtering and grouping,\naggregation, binning, and simple statistical analysis (mean, std, var, count, ..).\nplots can be faceted, layered and stacked vertically or horizontally.To install the package run Pkg.add(\"VegaLite\")."

Default value: true for x and y channel if the quantitative field is not binned and no custom domain is provided; false otherwise.  Default value: true for x and y channel if the quantitative field is not binned and no custom domain is provided; false otherwise.  Note:  This property is always false for log scale.\nrangeStep :   (Number or Void) The distance between the starts of adjacent bands or points in band or point scales. If this value is null, this will be determined to fit width (for x) or height (for y) of the plot. If both width and x-scale's rangeStep is provided, rangeStep will be dropped.  (The same rule is applied for height and y-scale's rangeStep.)  Default Rule: for x ordinal scale of a text mark, derived from scale config's textXRangeStep. Otherwise, derived from scale config's rangeStep. Warning: If the cardinality of the scale domain is too high, the rangeStep might become less than one pixel and the mark might not appear correctly.\npaddingOuter :   (Number) The outer padding determines the ratio of the range that is reserved for blank space before the first and after the last bands/points.\npadding : Applies spacing among ordinal elements in the scale range. The actual effect depends on how the scale is configured. If the points parameter is true, the padding value is interpreted as a multiple of the spacing between points. A reasonable value is 1.0, such that the first and last point will be offset from the minimum and maximum value by half the distance between points. Otherwise, padding is typically in the range [0, 1] and corresponds to the fraction of space in the range interval to allocate to padding. A value of 0.5 means that the band size will be equal to the padding width. For more, see the D3 ordinal scale documentation. A convenience property for setting the inner and outer padding to the same value.  Default value: x and y channels are derived from scale config's pointPadding for point scale and bandPadding for band scale.  Other channels have 0 padding by default. see help for vlpadding()\nrange :  see help for vlrange()\nclamp :   (Bool) If true, values that exceed the data domain are clamped to either the minimum or maximum range value  Default value: derived from scale config (true by default)  Supported types: only linear, pow, sqrt, and log (Not applicable for quantile, quantize, and threshold scales as they output discrete ranges.)\nround :   (Bool) If true, rounds numeric output values to integers. This can be helpful for snapping to the pixel grid.  Default Rule: true for \"x\", \"y\", \"row\", \"column\" channels if scale config's round is true; false otherwise.\nscheme :  see help for vlscheme()\nnice :   (Bool or String/Symbol) As quantitative scale property, if specified, modifies the scale domain to use a more human-friendly value range. If specified as a true boolean, modifies the scale domain to use a more human-friendly number range (e.g., 7 instead of 6.96). If specified as a string, modifies the scale domain to use a more human-friendly value range. For time and utc scale types only, the nice value should be a string indicating the desired time interval. As time scale properties, if true, values that exceed the data domain are clamped to either the minimum or maximum range value. (Not applicable for quantile, quantize, and threshold scales as they output discrete ranges.)

Default value: 21\nmaxFontSize :   (Number) The default max value for mapping quantitative fields to text's size/fontSize. If undefined (default), we will use bandSize - 1.  Default value: 40\nmaxBandSize :   (Number) The default max value for mapping quantitative fields to bar's size/bandSize. If undefined (default), we will use bandSize - 1.\ntextXRangeStep :   (Number) Default range step for x ordinal scale when is mark is text.  Default value: 90\nuseUnaggregatedDomain :   (Bool) Use the source data range before aggregation as scale domain instead of aggregated data for aggregate axis. This property only works with aggregate functions that produce values within the raw data domain (\"mean\", \"average\", \"median\", \"q1\", \"q3\", \"min\", \"max\"). For other aggregations that produce values outside of the raw data domain (e.g. \"count\", \"sum\"), this property is ignored.\nclamp :   (Bool) If true, values that exceed the data domain are clamped to either the minimum or maximum range value\npointPadding :   (Number) Default outer padding for x and y point-ordinal scales.  Default value: 0.5\nmaxSize :   (Number) Default max value for point size scale.\nround :   (Bool) If true, rounds numeric output values to integers. This can be helpful for snapping to the pixel grid. (Only available for x, y, size, row, and column scales.)\nshapes :   (Array of String/Symbol) The default collection of symbol shapes for mapping nominal fields to shapes of point marks (i.e., range of a shape scale). Each value should be one of: \"circle\", \"square\", \"cross\", \"diamond\", \"triangle-up\", or \"triangle-down\", or a custom SVG path.  Default value: [\"circle\", \"square\", \"cross\", \"diamond\", \"triangle-up\", \"triangle-down\"]\nminFontSize :   (Number) The default min value for mapping quantitative fields to tick's size/fontSize scale with zero=false  Default value: 8\nminBandSize :   (Number) The default min value for mapping quantitative fields to bar and tick's size/bandSize scale with zero=false If undefined (default), we will use the continuousBandSize value for bar and 3 for ticks.\nminOpacity :   (Number) Default minimum opacity for mapping a field to opacity.  Default value: 0.3\nmaxOpacity :   (Number) Default max opacity for mapping a field to opacity.  Default value: 0.8\nbandPaddingInner :   (Number) Default inner padding for x and y band-ordinal scales.  Default value: 0.1\nbandPaddingOuter :   (Number) Default outer padding for x and y band-ordinal scales. If not specified, by default, band scale's paddingOuter is paddingInner/2.\nminSize :   (Number) Default minimum value for point size scale with zero=false.
