For rendering it uses pre-defined design rules that keep the visualization specification succinct while still leaving user control.Vega-Lite supports :data transformation, sorting, filtering and grouping,\naggregation, binning, and simple statistical analysis (mean, std, var, count, ..).\nplots can be faceted, layered and stacked vertically or horizontally.To install the package run Pkg.add(\"VegaLite\")."

Default value: 0.7 for non-aggregate plots with point, tick, circle, or square marks or layered bar charts and 1 otherwise. see help for vlopacity()\nfontWeight :   (one of normal,bold or Number) The font weight (e.g., \"bold\").\nfilled :   (Bool) Whether the mark\'s color should be used as fill color instead of stroke color.  Default value: true for all marks except point and false for point.  Applicable for: bar, point, circle, square, and area marks.  Note: This property cannot be used in a style config.\nshape : The default symbol shape to use. One of: \"circle\" (default), \"square\", \"cross\", \"diamond\", \"triangle-up\", or \"triangle-down\", or a custom SVG path.  Default value: \"circle\" see help for vlshape()\ntheta :   (Number) Polar coordinate angle, in radians, of the text label from the origin determined by the x and y properties. Values for theta follow the same convention of arc mark startAngle and endAngle properties: angles are measured in radians, with 0 indicating \"north\".\nfontStyle :   (one of normal,italic)\nfont :   (String/Symbol) The typeface to set the text in (e.g., \"Helvetica Neue\").\nhref : A URL to load upon mouse click. If defined, the mark acts as a hyperlink. see help for vlhref()\nfillOpacity :   (Number) The fill opacity (value between [0,1]).  Default value: 1\ndx :   (Number) The horizontal offset, in pixels, between the text label and its anchor point.

For example: in the case of circles, the radius is determined in part by the square root of the size value.

Note that fill and stroke have higher precedence than color and will override color.  Default value: <span style=\"color: #4682b4;\">&#9632;</span> \"#4682b4\"  Note: This property cannot be used in a style config. see help for vlcolor()\ntext : Placeholder text if the text channel is not specified see help for vltext()\nbaseline :   (one of bottom,top,middle)\nlimit :   (Number) The maximum length of the text mark in pixels (default 0, indicating no limit).

If true, default binning parameters will be applied.  Default value: false see help for vlbin()\ntimeUnit :   (??? or ???)\nfield : Required. A string defining the name of the field from which to pull a data value or an object defining iterated values from the repeat operator.  Note: Dots (.) and brackets ([ and ]) can be used to access nested objects (e.g., \"field\": \"foo.bar\" and \"field\": \"foo[\'bar\']\"). If field names contain dots or brackets but are not nested, you can use \\\\ to escape dots and brackets (e.g., \"a\\\\.b\" and \"a\\\\[0\\\\]\"). See more details about escaping in the field documentation.  Note: field is not required if aggregate is count. see help for vlfield()\ncondition : One or more value definition(s) with a selection predicate.  Note: A field definition\'s condition property can only contain value definitions since Vega-Lite only allows at most one encoded field per encoding channel. see help for vlcondition()\naggregate :  see help for vlaggregate()\ntyp :   (one of ordinal,nominal,quantitative,temporal or one of geojson,latitude,longitude) Constants and utilities for data type    Data type based on level of measurement\ncase #2 A ValueDef with Condition<ValueDef | FieldDef> {    condition: {field: ...} | {value: ...},    value: ..., }\ncondition : A field definition or one or more value definition(s) with a selection predicate. see help for vlcondition()\nvalue :   (Number, String/Symbol or Bool) A constant value in visual domain.\n\n\n\n"
